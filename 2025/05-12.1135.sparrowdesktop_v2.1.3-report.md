🧾 **Sparrow Wallet Reproducibility Build Report**\
**Focus:** Verifying reproducibility of Sparrow Wallet desktop binaries using Docker\
**Period:** May 9,10 and 12, 2025\
**Build Target:** Sparrow Wallet v2.1.3 using `./gradlew jpackage` inside Docker\
**Builder:** Daniel Andrei R. Garcia (dannybuntu)

**Built Artifact:**
`output/Sparrow/bin/Sparrow` (portable Linux desktop binary)

`838663d33472241a0eefcca6072b23163fef931f9e4a7cc5a55dde2e9aba0f79`

**Binary Hash from Official Release:**
`838663d33472241a0eefcca6072b23163fef931f9e4a7cc5a55dde2e9aba0f79`
Filename: `sparrow-2.1.3-x86_64.tar.gz` (GitHub Release)

**Docker Setup and Image Creation**\
✅ Created project directory `~/work/builds/desktop/sparrow-build`\
✅ Authored `Dockerfile` based on `ubuntu:22.04`\
✅ Installed dependencies including `rpm`, `fakeroot`, `unzip`, etc.\
✅ Downloaded and unpacked Temurin OpenJDK 22.0.2\
✅ Cloned Sparrow Wallet repository (tag: v2.1.3) using `--recursive`\
✅ Triggered build via `./gradlew jpackage`\
✅ Docker image successfully built and tagged `sparrow-builder`

**Build Artifact Extraction**\
✅ Created container with `docker run -d --name sparrow-build-container ...`\
✅ Used `docker cp` to extract `/output/` contents from container\
✅ Verified presence of:

-   `Sparrow/` portable directory
-   `sparrow_2.1.3-1_amd64.deb`
-   `sparrow-2.1.3-1.x86_64.rpm`

📦 **Verifications Performed**

| File | SHA256 Match |
| --- | --- |
| `bin/Sparrow` | ✅ Yes |
| `.deb` package | ⚠️ Not tested |
| `.rpm` package | ⚠️ Not tested |

✅ Also performed `diff -r output/Sparrow official/Sparrow`
✅ Deep diff via `diffoscope` revealed only binary compression differences in `lib/runtime/lib/modules` (expected for Java builds)

🧠 **Binary Type Inspection**
Command: `file output/Sparrow/bin/Sparrow`\
Result:
`ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, not stripped`

🧠 **Observations and Lessons Learned**
✅ The `bin/Sparrow` binary built inside Docker was **bit-for-bit identical** with the official release\
✅ Java runtime differences (e.g., `lib/modules`) are **not critical** to app logic\
✅ Using Docker ensures clean, repeatable builds without host system contamination\
⚠️ `bash` inside container was unusable via `ENTRYPOINT` — resolved using `tail -f /dev/null` and `docker cp`\
✅ File system cleanliness was maintained by isolating `/output` and cleaning up containers after use\
