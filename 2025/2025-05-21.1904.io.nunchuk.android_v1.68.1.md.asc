## Nunchuk Android 1.68.1 – Reproducibility Verification Report

**App ID:** io.nunchuk.android\
**Version:** 1.68.1\
**Verification Date:** 2025-05-21\
**Verifier:** Daniel Andrei R. Garcia\
**Comparison Basis:** Full split APK diff (base.apk, split\_config.armeabi\_v7a.apk, split\_config.xhdpi.apk)

* * *

### 1\. **Summary of Diffs for 1.68.1**

#### **diff\_armeabi\_v7a.txt**

- -   `AndroidManifest.xml` differs (binary diff).
- -   `META-INF` directory **only in Play APK**.
- -   `stamp-cert-sha256` **only in Play APK**.

#### **diff\_base.txt**

- -   `AndroidManifest.xml` differs (binary diff).
- -   `resources.arsc` differs (binary diff).
- -   `stamp-cert-sha256` **only in Play APK**.

#### **diff\_xhdpi.txt**

- -   `AndroidManifest.xml` differs (binary diff).
- -   `META-INF` directory **only in Play APK**.
- -   `resources.arsc` differs (binary diff).
- -   `stamp-cert-sha256` **only in Play APK**.
* * *

### 2\. **Comparison with Previous Version (1.68.0)**

#### **What’s the Same:**

- -   All key binary diffs are present in both 1.68.0 and 1.68.1:
    -   `AndroidManifest.xml` diffs (all splits)
    -   `resources.arsc` diffs (`base` and `xhdpi` splits)
    -   `META-INF` and `stamp-cert-sha256` only present in Play Store APKs

#### **What’s Different:**

- -   **No new diffs** are observed in 1.68.1 compared to 1.68.0.
- -   All differences are consistent with expected, benign, and well-documented sources of non-reproducibility in Android apps (see below).
* * *

### 3\. **Major Changes / Concerns**

- -   **No new or concerning differences** are present in 1.68.1 vs 1.68.0.
- -   The diffs remain limited to:
    -   Play Store-injected files (`META-INF`, `stamp-cert-sha256`)
    -   Binary differences in `AndroidManifest.xml` (explained below)
    -   Binary differences in `resources.arsc` (explained below)
- -   **No changes** to services, activities, or manifest-level metadata that would indicate tampering or significant build environment change.
* * *

### 4\. **Assessment of Reproducibility**

#### **Binary Diffs: Are They Problematic?**

- -   **AndroidManifest.xml differences**:
    -   These remain benign, as explained in 1.68.0: Play Store injects `<meta-data>` tags and modifies the manifest for distribution.
    -   **No evidence** of semantic or security-impacting changes.
- -   **resources.arsc differences**:
    -   All resource **strings and identifiers are bit-identical** except for the `com.google.firebase.crashlytics.mapping_file_id`, which is expected to change per build (tied to ProGuard/R8).
    -   **No semantic or functional difference**; only word alignment, resource ordering, and padding differ due to aapt2 toolchain non-determinism.
    -   These are **documented and widely accepted as benign** in Android reproducibility.
- -   **META-INF and stamp-cert-sha256**:
    -   Only present in Play Store APKs due to Google signing.
    -   **Always ignored** for reproducibility assessments.

#### **Conclusion**

- -   **1.68.1 is reproducible to the same degree as 1.68.0.**
- -   All observed differences are **expected, explainable, and benign** given the Android build and Play Store publishing processes.
- -   **No regressions** or additional concerns were introduced in 1.68.1.
