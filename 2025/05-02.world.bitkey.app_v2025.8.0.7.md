### Summary of Reproducibility Attempt

The reproducibility verification for Bitkey Android app v2025.8.0.7 was attempted following the official documentation atÂ [https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey/blob/main/app/verifiable-build/android/README.md.](https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey/blob/main/app/verifiable-build/android/README.md.)Â The verification process was not successful due to issues with the Docker build environment and Gradle build failures.

### Chronological Breakdown

#### Initial Setup (15:28 - 15:33)

-   Created environment setup script (

    ```
    setup-bitkey-env.sh
    ```

    ) to prepare for Bitkey reproducible build verification
-   Script configured:
    -   ANDROID\_HOME environment variable
    -   Android SDK command-line tools
    -   AAPT2 path
    -   Docker installation check
    -   ADB for device connection
    -   Bundletool download (v1.15.6)
-   Fixed initial script issues with Android command-line tools directory structure

#### Repository Preparation (15:35 - 15:40)

-   Successfully cloned the Bitkey repository:

    `git clone https://github.com/proto-at-block/bitkey.git`

-   Initiated submodule update:

    `git submodule update --init --recursive`

-   Set required environment variables:

    `export BUNDLETOOL="/home/dannybuntu/work/builds/android/world.bitkey.app/2025.8.0.7/bundletool.jar" export AAPT2="$ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/34.0.0/aapt2"`

#### Verification Attempt (15:40 - 17:10)

-   Executed verification script:

    `app/verifiable-build/android/verification/verify-android-apk . ../verify-apk`

-   Successfully downloaded and unpacked APK from connected device
-   Encountered Docker build failures due to package availability issues:
    -   Original Dockerfile specified exact package versions that were no longer available in Ubuntu Jammy repositories
    -   Initial error:

        ```
        git=1:2.34.1-1ubuntu1.12 not found
        ```
    -   Modified Dockerfile to use available git version:

        ```
        1:2.43.0-1ubuntu7.2
        ```

    -   Further repository errors with 404 Not Found for multiple packages

#### Dockerfile Modifications

-   Updated Dockerfile to address repository issues:
    -   Modified sources.list to use archive.ubuntu.com instead of security.ubuntu.com
    -   Removed specific version constraints while documenting original versions
    -   Used apt-get with --no-install-recommends for more reliable package installation

#### Build Failure (17:10)

-   Docker build succeeded with modified Dockerfile
-   Gradle build process started but failed during the APK building process
-   Final error: "Gradle build daemon disappeared unexpectedly (it may have been killed or may have crashed)"
-   Specific error occurred during the native library stripping process:

    `Unable to strip the following libraries, packaging them as they are: libandroidx.graphics.path.so, libbdkffi.so, libbugsnag-ndk.so, libbugsnag-plugin-android-anr.so, libbugsnag-root-detection.so, libcore.so, libdatastore_shared_counter.so, libfirmware.so, libimage_processing_util_jni.so, libjnidispatch.so, libsqlcipher.so.`

-   Warning related to androidx.navigation.NavType method missing

### Technical Challenges Encountered

1.  **Environment Setup Issues**
    -   Android command-line tools directory structure required adjustment
    -   Path configuration needed for sdkmanager access
2.  **Docker Build Environment Problems**
    -   Package version mismatches between Dockerfile specifications and available repositories
    -   Repository 404 errors for security.ubuntu.com
    -   Outdated package references in the Dockerfile
3.  **Reproducibility Compromises**
    -   Had to remove exact package version constraints to allow build to proceed
    -   This undermines true reproducibility as package versions affect build output
4.  **Gradle Build Failure**
    -   Build crashed during native library processing
    -   Possible memory limitations or compatibility issues with the build environment

### Conclusion

The attempt to verify the reproducibility of Bitkey Android App v2025.8.0.7 was unsuccessful. The primary obstacles were:

1.  Outdated package references in the Docker build environment
2.  Repository availability issues for specific package versions
3.  Gradle build process failure during native library processing

These issues highlight the challenges of maintaining reproducible builds over time as package repositories evolve and dependencies change. For a truly reproducible build system, the Bitkey project would benefit from:

1.  Using fixed, archived repositories that don't change over time
2.  Implementing a more robust build environment that's less sensitive to external package availability
3.  Addressing the Gradle daemon crash during the native library stripping process

The verification process was marked as failed, as we were unable to complete the build from source and compare it with the installed APK.
