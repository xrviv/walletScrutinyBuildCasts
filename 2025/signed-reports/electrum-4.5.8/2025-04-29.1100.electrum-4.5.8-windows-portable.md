üìù Reproducibility Report for `electrum-4.5.8-portable.exe`
===========================================================

Summary
-------

-   **Builder**: Daniel Andrei R. Garcia

-   **System**: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)

-   **Docker Version**: 20.10.24+dfsg1, build 297e128

-   **Build Timestamp**: 2025-04-29 08:41 UTC

-   **Log URL**: [Build Log](https://github.com/xrviv/walletScrutinyBuildCasts/blob/main/2025/2025-04-29.0841.electrumdesktop-windows_v4.5.8.log)

Steps Taken
-----------

1.  **Built locally** using the same process as for other binaries.

2.  **Downloaded the official signed `electrum-4.5.8-portable.exe`** manually, since `unsign.sh` was only configured for one file.

3.  **Manually stripped Authenticode signature** using:

    `osslsigncode remove-signature -in signed/electrum-4.5.8-portable.exe -out signed/stripped/electrum-4.5.8-portable.exe`

4.  **Compared SHA256** checksums.

    ```
    danny@lw10:~/work/builds/desktop/electrum/contrib/build-wine$ sha256sum dist/electrum-4.5.8-portable.exe signed/stripped/electrum-4.5.8-portable.exe
    14701b141dc02bd8d2d0f1b713aa5ee34cfc29d16a0b6818ae2525840601df2c  dist/electrum-4.5.8-portable.exe
    14701b141dc02bd8d2d0f1b713aa5ee34cfc29d16a0b6818ae2525840601df2c  signed/stripped/electrum-4.5.8-portable.exe
    ```



5.  **Result**: ‚úÖ **Perfect Match** --- confirms successful reproducibility after stripping signature.

Notes
-----

-   Detour: Had to manually download and process portable binary --- `unsign.sh` did not handle it automatically.

-   Signature removal was key to achieve reproducibility.

Conclusion
----------

*`electrum-4.5.8-portable.exe` was successfully reproduced with no discrepancies after signature removal.*
