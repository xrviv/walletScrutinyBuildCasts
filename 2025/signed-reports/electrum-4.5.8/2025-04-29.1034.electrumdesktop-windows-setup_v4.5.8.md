üìù Reproducibility Report for `electrum-4.5.8-setup.exe`
========================================================

Summary
-------

-   **Builder**: Daniel Andrei R. Garcia

-   **System**: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)

-   **Docker Version**: 20.10.24+dfsg1, build 297e128

-   **Build Timestamp**: 2025-04-29 10:31 UTC+8

-   **Log URL**: [Build Log](https://github.com/xrviv/walletScrutinyBuildCasts/blob/main/2025/2025-04-29.0841.electrumdesktop-windows_v4.5.8.log)

Steps Taken
-----------

1.  **Built the setup executable** with Electrum's standard Dockerized Windows build process.

2.  **Downloaded the official signed `electrum-4.5.8-setup.exe`** manually.

3.  **Stripped the Authenticode signature** manually:

    `osslsigncode remove-signature -in signed/electrum-4.5.8-setup.exe -out signed/stripped/electrum-4.5.8-setup.exe`

4.  **SHA256 Comparison** confirmed binary match after stripping.

    ```
    danny@lw10:~/work/builds/desktop/electrum/contrib/build-wine$ sha256sum dist/electrum-4.5.8-setup.exe signed/stripped/electrum-4.5.8-setup.exe
    26cb235b5df717a2969c208aa5faa59e29faa2a2dcc2f17072b50c30158e8913  dist/electrum-4.5.8-setup.exe
    26cb235b5df717a2969c208aa5faa59e29faa2a2dcc2f17072b50c30158e8913  signed/stripped/electrum-4.5.8-setup.exe
    ```

5.  **Result**: ‚úÖ **Perfect Match** with official unsigned structure.

Notes
-----

-   The signed `.exe` from the official server needed manual processing --- `unsign.sh` did not automatically fetch and strip it.

-   Manual intervention was straightforward using `osslsigncode`.

Conclusion
----------

üîç *`electrum-4.5.8-setup.exe` reproducibility was successfully verified after controlled signature removal.*
